# Queue_Vector

	Definition of the Data Structure:
  
	To allow the reuse of the positions already occupied, the concept of "Circular Queue" is used.
	We need a new component to indicate how many elements there are in the queue at the moment.
  
  1. Create - creates an empty queue
  
  2. Empty - tests if a queue is empty

  3. First - gets the element from the beginning of the queue
  
  5. Inserts - inserts an element at the end of a queue
  
  6. Removes - removes the element from the beginning of a queue, returning the removed element
  
  7. Empty - removes all elements from the queue.
  
  8. PrintQueue - prints all elements of the queue.
